- When you include static images in your assets collection xCode will auto generate enums for you to use, to avoid spelling misake
Image(.image)

- To resize an image you need to add Modifer resizable and to specifiy conent mode is it scalledToFill or scalledToFit (both as modifer as well)

Image(.image)
.resizable()
.scaledToFit()


- To speicify relative width or height for example I want my Image to be 80% of the parent width we can do this using a modifer called containerRelativeFrame this should return a value to use for the specified axies for example I want my Image WIDTH to be 80% of parent width we can use this
Image(.image)
.containerRelativeFrame(.horizontal) { size,_ in
size * 0.8
}


please note this return a CGFloat to be applied to the image itself, so Image().frame() will be replaced with the above
